For a number of years I also kept up a mediawiki, which I plan to revive soon and a link will appear here.

I cover my machine learning research with audio and other technical topics on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVN9mbPYSdV3NPhIrcHcqHQ).

I make music too! I post partially finished works of original music [soundcloud.com/init-dot-d](https://soundcloud.com/init-dot-d).

Sometimes a few of them make it to Spotify, like this [album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3r7wDRDBdw7eVoXR2VZyXl).

I also enjoy making music videos with Blender and you can find a few here on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxMdeZM8FcPajhtRD_gtD2Q/videos).
